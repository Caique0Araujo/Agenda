# Agenda

Agenda is an web application developed with Node platform using technologies such as Express.Js, Sequelize.Js, Bcrypt.Js and others.
The purpose of this application is to develop my node skills that i've learnt on free time.
It's a simple database application with login validation that stores contacts, events and groups information.
Feel free to use and give me some tips about how i can improve :)
